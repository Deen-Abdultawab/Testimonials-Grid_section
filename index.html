          I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I Joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

          " I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended
        </p>
  
        <blockquote class="review-text">
          " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of thiers who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I;ve often referred to it during interviewa as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
